# ExcelYourGames

Little program that lists every game you own on Steam as an .xlsx file with the hours you played the game.

Still a bit to do.

#ToDo
- include other game platforms
- add the option to see more information about the listed games in the .xlsx file
- creating an .exe file so the program does not have to be run inside an IDE
- and so on
